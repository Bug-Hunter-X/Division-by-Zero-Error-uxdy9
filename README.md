# Division by Zero Bug in JavaScript This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: division by zero. The `bug.js` file contains a function `divide` that does not handle the case where the divisor is zero, resulting in an error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the function that handles this case gracefully. This example highlights the importance of handling potential errors in code to prevent unexpected crashes and ensure program stability.
